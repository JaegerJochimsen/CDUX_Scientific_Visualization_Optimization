# Optimizations for Post-Hoc Interpolation in Flow Visualization Using Delaunay Triangulations
## Background:
Consider a set of basis flows, where a flow is denoted by a start and an end point (s<sub>i</sub>, e<sub>i</sub>)

## Dependencies
1. CGAL
2. VTK

## File Manifest
*Software Files*
1. reconstruct.cxx      - source code for the project
2. genPts.py            - a script used for generating .vtk test data of variable length 

*Data File(s)*
1. Groundtruth_0_0.vtk  - a set of test start and end points for basis flows

*Config File(s)*
1. CMakeLists.txt       - a cmake file used to generate a makefile for the project
